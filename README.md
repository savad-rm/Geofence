## 📋 Overview
Build a complete full-stack application with real-time capabilities. You will develop:

1. **Backend API (Go)** - RESTful API for geofencing and vehicle tracking
2. **Real-time Alert System (Go)** - Alert notification system (WebSocket or alternative approach)
3. **Frontend Application (React)** - Web interface to interact with the system and receive live alerts

You will build a geofencing and vehicle tracking system where users can define virtual boundaries (geofences) around specific areas and track vehicles in real-time. When a vehicle enters or exits a geofenced zone—especially restricted areas—the system sends immediate alerts. Users can create geofences by drawing boundaries on a map or providing coordinates, register and track vehicles, view historical movements, configure alert rules for different vehicles and zones, and access everything through an intuitive web dashboard with live updates.

## 🎯 Objective

Build a complete geofencing and vehicle tracking system that:
- Manages geofences (virtual boundaries) and vehicle locations
- Tracks when vehicles enter or exit geofenced areas
- Sends real-time alerts when vehicles enter restricted zones
- Provides a user-friendly web interface for system interaction

## 📡 Backend Requirements

### API Response Format

**IMPORTANT**: Every API response must include execution time in nanoseconds:

```json
{
  // ... response data
  "time_ns": "1234567"
}
```

Measure time using Go's `time` package at the start and end of each request handler.

---

## 🔴 Real-time Alert System

You need to implement a real-time alert notification system. When `POST /vehicles/location` detects that a vehicle has entered or exited a geofenced area (based on configured alert rules), the system should immediately notify connected clients.

### Recommended Approach: WebSocket

**WebSocket Endpoint**: `/ws/alerts`

Implement a WebSocket server that:
1. Accepts connections from frontend clients
2. Broadcasts real-time alerts when geofence events occur
3. Supports multiple concurrent connections
4. Handles connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect)

**WebSocket Message Format**:
```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_999",
  "event_type": "entry",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:35:00Z",
  "vehicle": {
    "vehicle_id": "veh_456",
    "vehicle_number": "KA-01-AB-1234",
    "driver_name": "John Doe"
  },
  "geofence": {
    "geofence_id": "geo_123",
    "geofence_name": "Downtown Delivery Zone",
    "category": "delivery_zone"
  },
  "location": {
    "latitude": 37.7849,
    "longitude": -122.4194
  }
}
```

**WebSocket Libraries**:
- Gorilla WebSocket (popular choice for Go)
- nhooyr.io/websocket



### Integration Requirements

Regardless of the approach chosen:
- When `POST /vehicles/location` detects an entry/exit event, check for matching alert configurations
- Generate an alert with the format shown above
- Deliver the alert to connected clients in real-time
- Handle the alert delivery asynchronously (don't block the HTTP response)
- Store all alerts in the database for historical records

---

## 🎨 Frontend Requirements

Build a React-based web application with the following capabilities:

### Required Features

#### 1. **Geofence Management**
- Provide a way to create new geofences with name, description, category, and coordinates
- Display list of all geofences with filtering by category
- **Preferred approach**: Interactive map where users can see polygons that define geofence boundaries and vehicle locations.

#### 2. **Vehicle Management**
- Provide a way to register new vehicles with vehicle number, driver name, vehicle type, and phone
- Display list of all registered vehicles
- Show current location and geofence status for each vehicle

#### 3. **Location Updates**
- Provide a way to update vehicle locations with latitude, longitude, and timestamp
- Display which geofences the vehicle is currently inside
- **Preferred approach**: Interactive map where users can click to set vehicle location

#### 4. **Alert Configuration**
- Provide a way to configure alert rules by selecting geofence, vehicle (optional), and event type
- Display all configured alert rules
- Ability to view and manage existing alerts

#### 5. **Real-time Alert Notifications** ⭐
- Connect to your backend's real-time alert system
- Display incoming alerts as they occur with:
  - Vehicle information
  - Geofence name and category
  - Event type (entry/exit)
  - Timestamp and location
- Recommended: Use toast notifications, alert banners, or a dedicated alerts feed

#### 6. **Violation History**
- Display historical geofence events
- Support filtering by vehicle, geofence, and date range
- Handle pagination for large datasets

### Technical Guidelines

- **Clean, intuitive interface** with clear visual feedback
- **Loading states** for all API operations
- **User friendly** with user-friendly UI and messages
- **Responsive design** that works on different screen sizes

### Recommended Map Integration

For the best user experience, integrate a map library to:
- Visualize geofences as polygons on a map
- Show vehicle locations as markers
- Allow users to input geofences and show directly on the map
- Allow users to click on the map or throgh inputs to set vehicle locations
